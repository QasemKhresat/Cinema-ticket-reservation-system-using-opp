# Cinema-ticket-reservation-system-using-opp

This is a system that books tickets to watch movies in the cinema, where it stores the userâ€™s information such as his name, age, and phone number with a system that verifies the validity of the phone number. Then it records the number of the movie that you want to watch, then books the number of tickets reserved from the number of original tickets. Then, after finishing, it displays the ticket details. 

Note: it gives you the option to rebook other tickets if you want.

Note: When the number of tickets allocated for each movie is finished, the system will delete that movie, and when you try to book again, the booking system will be empty of the expired movie number.
